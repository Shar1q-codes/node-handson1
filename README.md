# Node JS

> Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications.

> Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting — running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
 
> Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.

> Node.js was written initially by Ryan Dahl in 2009,[24] about thirteen years after the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape's LiveWire Pro Web.


# Features of Node JS

Following are some of the important features that make Node.js the first choice of software architects.

> Asynchronous and Event Driven − All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.

> Very Fast − Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.

> Single Threaded but Highly Scalable − Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests. Node.js uses a single threaded program and the same program can provide service to a much larger number of requests than traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server.

> No Buffering − Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.

#Node.js is best suitable for:
> Real-time web applications,
> Streaming applications,
> Messaging apps,
> Chat programs,
> Social media apps,
> Virtual emulators,
> Multiplayer games,
> Collaboration tools,
> API.
